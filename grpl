# generating a uuid will use it later to supress stdout
uuid=$(openssl rand -hex 16 | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')

# Problem statement : storing all stdouts into a log files, and nothing should be displayed on terminal
# In following commands "   | grep $uuid " part is used to suppress the stdout
# if we suppress logs using >/dev/null then "tee -ia "$GRPL_WORKDIR/logs/install.log" also doesn't produce any output
# its because we have nulled the stdout and tee just replicates the stdout.
# Another solution was to create a log func that just receives the commands and execute it and send its output to a log file while suppressing the logs
# e.g file_log() { eval "$1" >> "$2" 2>&1 }
#  file_log "kubectl get pods" cluster.log 
#  file_log "kubectl get pods" cluster_install.log 
#  so we had to run everything twice to save logs on 2 file or at least copy logs from one file to another everytime
#  Thats why I though approach 1 is better, becase in that case we won't have to create any extra funtions we can utilize tee
